# Thanks for helping!

### Workflow
- We have PR apps set up, so please make sure the page works prior to approving PRs
- One PR approval required pre-merge


### Setup

Right now the repo is set up for a simple static site, serving everything in `/public`.

Use `yarn dev` for local development.
- Listen to changes and restart the dev server
- Listen for changes to sass files and concat and compile into css
- Listen for changes to html files and run gulp-file-include to allow for html includes
